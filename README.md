BlockEdfSpectralSummarizeFig
============================

Create spectral summaries and figures from spectral output generated from SpectralTrainFig.

#### Questions
Please post questions at [https://sleepdata.org/forum](https://sleepdata.org/forum)

#### Overview
BlockEdfSpectralSummarizeFig is a GUI that facilitates review of spectral analysis output generated by [SpectralTrainFig](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/49852-spectraltrainfig). Program is includes functions for visualizing, summarizing and adjudication of spectral output.

#### Application Functions
1. Select spectral summary file (Button with Elipses)
2. Set study test string that is used as a prefix for generated file names
3. Click 'Load' to load spectral summary file
4. Select Monitor to display results.
5. Edit signal labels to include in summary
6. Select adjudication summary if you have one.  Otherwise, data used in summary is by total power percentile.
7. Edit subject ID function to extract subject id from file name.
8. Click 'Idenitfy NaNs' to list subjects with out an entry.
9. Click 'Plot Total Power' to generate total power plots.
10. Click 'Plot Spectrograms' to generate total power plots.
11. Click 'Plot Average Spectra' to generate average spectra plots.
12. Click 'Band Plots' to generate band plots.

#### GUI vs. Class
The GUI is designed to provide access to the BlockSpectralSummarizeClass.  The class includes public and private properties that can be accessed directly to tailor the spectral summary.  See the [BlockSpectralSummarizeClass](https://github.com/DennisDean/BlockEdfSpectralSummarizeFig/blob/master/BlockSpectralSummarizeClass.m) header for additional information.

#### Limitations

The adjudication options is not implemented in all functions.  Curently inplemented in the 'Plot Average Spectra' and 'Band Plots'.
